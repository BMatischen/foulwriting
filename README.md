# About

You've made it the final of your school's annual writing competition and it's a few minutes away from the deadline before you need to submit your story to be judged. Not only do you have to finish your piece super fast, you also have to worry about your rival whose superior writing skills will leave you in the dust. 

You can only win if you submit on time and tamper with your rival's writing. Fortunately for you, you managed to get remote access to their document by figuring out the password (it was password123). 

It's time to break some rules. Just keep your eye on the time and don't get caught...
